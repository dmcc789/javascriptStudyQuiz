This is a coding quiz that iterates through 5 questions while counting down.  I was not able to get to the final stage of storing the score and showing that score with initals on the highscores page.  It took me a very long time to solve the issues of presenting all of the questions.  I am interested in any and all feedback you may have for me on this assignment.  Thanks!
